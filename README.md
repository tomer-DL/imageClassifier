## Face classifier using open CV and deep learning

This is an educational project aimed at studying face recognition.

* In the **1st part** I am gathering face images dataset by using images saved on my computer.
I am using Haar Cascade to recognize faces inside images, and extract those faces to create a faces dataset.

* In the **2nd part**, since the Haar Cascade isn't totally accurate, I am training a deep neural network to distinguish
between true face images and false face images.

* In the **3rd part** I am using the deep neural network created in the second part to weed out the non-face images from our dataset.

* For the **4th part** I prepared a few directories, each with images of a different person. After that I am training a neural network to identify each person.

* In the **5th part** I am using the neural network created in the forth part to sort the rest of the images.
