<h2 align='center'>Face classifier using open CV and deep learning</h2>

<div>
This is an educational project aimed at studying face recognition.<br/> 
In the first part I am gathering a face images dataset by using images saved on my computer.</br>
I am using Haar Cascade to recognize faces inside images, and extract those faces to creat a faces dataset.
In the second part, since the Haar Cascade isn't totally accurate, I am using deep neural network to distinguish
true faces images and false face images.<\br>
In the third part I am using the deep learning network created in the second part to weed out the non-face images from our dataset.<\br>
