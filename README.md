## Face classifier using open CV and deep learning

This is an educational project aimed at studying face recognition.


In the first part I am gathering face images dataset by using images saved on my computer.
I am using Haar Cascade to recognize faces inside images, and extract those faces to create a faces dataset.


In the second part, since the Haar Cascade isn't totally accurate, I am training a deep neural network to distinguish
between true face images and false face images.


In the third part I am using the deep neural network created in the second part to weed out the non-face images from our dataset.
