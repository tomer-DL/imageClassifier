# Training on a sample of the data

Deep learning works best on a big dataset. In my case, after the first part, I had about 10,000 images.
Sorting through those images can be a tedious job.
So instead of sorting all of those images, I decided to create a smaller sample. 
Then, run it through the neural network, and let the deep learning do the initial sorting.

For this part, you should take 200 genuine face images and put them in one directory.
then take 200 non face images and put them in another directory.

set the properties (or leave them with default values):
input.images.faces= The faces images directory
input.images.other= The non faces images directory
images.extension= The faces images extension (i.e. .jpg)
face.size.height= The width of the images (150 if you didn't change the default in part1)
face.size.width= The height of the images (150 if you didn't change the default in part1)
output.dataset.dir= The output directory for the dataset files
dataset.file.name.x= The file name of the file containing the images
dataset.file.name.y= The file name of the file containing the labels for the images (1 for face, 0 for non-face)
